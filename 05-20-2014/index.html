                        <p>Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.</p>

                        <p>"Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye see?"</p>

                        <p>"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where you stand?"</p>

                        <p>I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any&mdash;I thought the best&mdash;and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.</p>

                        <p>"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off," he added&mdash;"come along with ye." And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.</p>
